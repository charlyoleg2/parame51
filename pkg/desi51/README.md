Desi51
======


Presentation
------------

*Desi51* is a *javascript* package containing a couple of programmatic CAD designs based on *Geometrix*. Those designs are used to illustrate the usage of *Geometrix* and *Paramui* and to help at their development.

You can use *desi51* as a boilerplate for your own designs. Rename and modify the example designs.


Getting started
---------------

```bash
git clone https://github.com/charlyoleg2/parame51
cd parame51
npm -w desi51 install
npm -w desi51 ci
```

Dependencies
------------

*Desi51* runtime depends only on *Geometrix*. Use *desi51-ui* WebUI or *desi51-cli* CLI to visualize and export the designs in different formats like dxf, svg, gltf, stl, brep, step and others.
